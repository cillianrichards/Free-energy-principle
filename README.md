This program will provide a mathematical representation of the human brain 

**Aims**  \
One reason to model the human brain is to understand ourselves better. This has been seen as an important part of being a human since Ancient Greece, where "know thyself" was printed atop the Temple of Delphi. I hope that through building this model I will come to understand myself better and bring other contributors along on the ride. 
My main aim from this project is to set up a dialogue between humans to investigate what this organ inside our heads does. I think this is becoming increasingly important in an age where machines are surpasing human intelligence, at least in certain domains such as language generation. One way to prevent machines from acting in a way that is harmful to humans is to give the machines a better understanding of what it is to be human. It is more likely that a machine will unintentionally harm a human if it has an incorrect model of the human brain.
